[ ] implement pragmas, don't just skip them
[ ] in a line-character comment, '}' should not be allowed immediately after ';'
[ ] right now, doc comments are only supported before procedures. is that good?
[ ] code gen should use types other than int ?
[ ] why is Param a list of identifiers? there should be only one param.
[ ] postfix operators need to handle opers other than ++ and --
[ ] expressions should be transformed a lot before being converted to C
        example: `x + y` in souc is *not* the same as x + y in C
[ ] subroutines should also be converted (mapped?) to do the right thing.
[ ] maybe don't use haskell's `String` and `++` for code gen, that seems slow
[ ] generating params is really not implemented at all
[ ] don't always assume `int`, that was super lazy hacking
[ ] keep bindings of variables (not only constants)
